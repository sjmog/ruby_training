To get the most out of this training, you must follow a golden rule: wait until you have the headache, before reaching for the aspirin.

It's easy to get stuck in a rabbit hole when learning to program, and every article you read leads to every other article – it's overwhelming. For this training, avoid following the rabbit hole. There's zero credit for extra reading. In fact, there's extra credit, the less reading you do – unless you really need it.
