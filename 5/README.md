# Loops, somehow

Write a program that produces a working, searchable contact book.

### How to complete this exercise

1. Use the branch you created in exercise 1. (If you skipped straight here, from the command line, run `git checkout -b my-full-name`)
2. In this directory, create a Ruby program file called `contacts.rb`.
3. To complete a requirement, add the code which completes the requirement to this file.
3. Once you have saved the Ruby program file, commit your changes with git and push to this repo.
4. You will get feedback on your solution via email.

### How to use Terminal programs

Unlike exercise 1, this program does not run in IRB. Instead, it runs directly in the Terminal. To start a Terminal program, run `ruby contacts.rb`.

## Requirements

### Starting the program in the Terminal

I can start the program by writing:

`ruby contacts.rb`
