2. In this directory, create a Ruby program file called `greeter.rb`.
3. To complete a requirement, add the code which completes the requirement to this file.
3. Once you have saved the Ruby program file, commit your changes with git and push to this repo.
4. You will get feedback on your solution via email.

### Testing your progress

You have to run your program yourself to test it in this exercise.

### How to use Terminal programs
